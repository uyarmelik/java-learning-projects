# Java Applications
This repository contains a variety of Java applications created to learn and practice fundamental programming concepts. These projects aim to bring key Java topics such as object-oriented programming (OOP), graphical user interface (GUI) development with Java Swing, and game programming to life in a practical way. Each project is designed to provide hands-on learning opportunities to understand and apply Java's core features.
